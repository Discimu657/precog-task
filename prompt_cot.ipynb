      "### Step 1: Examine the Initial String and Transitions\n",
      "\n",
      "The initial string is `'R'=w!(~[` and we have 7 transitions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. `'HV` -> `\"\"`\n",
      "2. `X%[` -> `\"\"`\n",
      "3. `DIb/` -> `\"\"`\n",
      "4. `@t~` -> `DIb/%`\n",
      "5. `iZ^-` -> `HVX@t`\n",
      "6. `Rs` -> `iZ^'H`\n",
      "7. `=w!(` -> `HVsV-`\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Reasoning Behind Each Transformation Step\n",
      "\n",
      "Our goal is to transform the initial string into a blank string by applying these transitions in a specific order. We need to find a sequence of transitions that will eventually lead to the removal of all characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the initial string `'R'=w!(~[`, we can see that it contains the substring `=w!(`, which is the source of transition 7. This transition replaces `=w!(` with `HVsV-`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Decide the Order of Applying Transitions\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start by applying transition 7 to the initial string:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Initial string: `'R'=w!(~[`\n",
      "- Apply transition 7 (`=w!(` -> `HVsV-`): `'R'HVsV-(~[`\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we have a new string. We should look for substrings in this new string that match the sources of the given transitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The string `'R'HVsV-(~[` does not directly match any of the sources of the transitions 1 through 6. However, we notice that transition 5 (`iZ^-` -> `HVX@t`) and transition 6 (`Rs` -> `iZ^'H`) could potentially be useful if we had the substrings `iZ^-` or `Rs` in our string. But first, we need to deal with the characters we have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since we don't have an immediate match, let's reconsider our approach and look for any possible matches:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The substring `HVsV-` from the result of applying transition 7 does not directly match any source.\n",
      "- However, we notice that `'HV` is a source for transition 1. If we can get `'HV` in our string, we can apply transition 1 to remove it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how do we get `'HV`? We already have `HVsV-` from applying transition 7. Let's look for a way to transform `HVsV-` into something useful or to apply other transitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the transitions, a key insight is to look for ways to introduce substrings that are sources for other transitions, especially those that result in blank strings or substrings that can be further reduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Linear Reasoning to Derive the Final Solution\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's re-evaluate our approach based on the transitions provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. We start with `'R'=w!(~[`.\n",
      "2. Applying transition 7 (`=w!(` -> `HVsV-`) gives us `'R'HVsV-(~[`.\n",
      "3. Now, we look for a way to apply the other transitions. Notice that if we had `Rs`, we could apply transition 6 to get `iZ^'H`, which could potentially lead to further simplifications.\n",
      "4. However, our immediate goal should be to simplify the string using the available transitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complexity and the specific transitions, a direct path isn't immediately clear without systematically trying to match each transition to the current state of the string and exploring all possible paths.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, let's consider a strategic approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "- We aim to remove characters, so any transition that results in a blank string or sets up for further removal is beneficial.\n",
      "- Transition 7 was applied to introduce `HVsV-`, but without a direct way to remove `HVsV-` or parts of it using the given transitions, we must reconsider our strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the transitions and the goal to reach a blank string, the process involves systematically applying transitions that can reduce the string length or set up for further reductions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Solution\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complexity of the problem and the need for a systematic approach to apply the transitions, let's outline a potential solution path based on the transitions provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Apply transition 7 to replace `=w!(` with `HVsV-`, resulting in `'R'HVsV-(~[`.\n",
      "2. Look for opportunities to apply transitions 1 through 6 to reduce the string further.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, without a clear path to apply these transitions directly to the result of step 1, we recognize the need for a methodical exploration of all possible transitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the format required for the solution and the need to provide a step-by-step application of the transitions, the challenge lies in identifying the correct sequence that leads to a blank string.\n",
